# ResNet Image Classification Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a **ResNet-based convolutional neural network** for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras.

- `Copy_of_FinalResnetModel-2 (1).ipynb`: The main notebook containing the model architecture, training loop, and evaluation.

- Based on **ResNet architecture** (Residual Networks)
- Includes:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Model building with residual blocks
  - Training and evaluation
  - Performance visualization (accuracy, loss plots)
  -
